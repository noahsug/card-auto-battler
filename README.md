# Card Auto Battler

## analysis

always play best card strategy

- seed by playing randomly, then sorting by win rate: 47.4% win rate
- seed by playing randomly, then sorting by confidence score: 46% win rate
- iteratively playing and updating card priority: 39% win rate
- iteratively train neural network on input of win rate -> confidence score for each card
- iteratively train neural network on input of confidence score for each card -> win rate then
  iterate over random values returning best predicted score

## gameplay

effects implemented

- bleed: 0,
- extraCardPlays: 0,
- dodge: 0,
- strength: 0
- damage
- repeat
- effect from player value
- heal
- lifesteal

archetypes implemented

- strength - multihit, double strength, applies strength twice
- bleed - multihit, repeat, dmg for each bleed
- low hp - self damage, 50% lifesteal when < 50% health, set health to half
- no self buffs - double damage if no self buffs, remove all self effects
- mill (heal, dodge, trash) - heal 7 and deal damage for every health over max
- trash -
- multicard - +1 damage for each card played this turn

## simple card effects

- gain 1 strength each turn
- reduce all dmg to 1 next turn
- gain dodge whenever you deal more than X damage
- dmg for each card played this turn

## archetypes

- buff stacking (next dmg card is played twice, +2 dmg, applies bleed for each dmg, 2x damage, 25% lifesteal, etc)
- âœ… bleed (hit 3 times, bleed 2, hit for each bleed, dmg causes bleed, 2x bleed)
- growth (+1 dmg each time played, +1 multihit each time played, heal +1 each time played, add X to deck)
- shuffle (+1 dmg for each card played this turn, +1 multihit for each shuffle, shuffle cards and play a card)
- many cards (1 dmg for each card in deck/discard)
- trash (add X to deck that trashes when played, trash 2 play 2, dmg for each trashed card, opponent trashes all cards played next turn, trash = heal 1)
- random (random debuff, random events have multihit)
- card selection (embeds in 2nd card picked - multihit 1, +2 dmg, always played first)
- low health (X when < 50% health - life steal, multihit, self damage, bleed self, +1 strength when dealing self damage, when < opponent health do X)
- high health (heal 4, regen 3, blessed +X health when restoring health, lifesteal, deal 50% of healed dmg, multihit when health > 10)
- non-damaging cards (non-damaging cards have play another card, non-damaging have +3 heal, no damage can be delt until your next turn)
- block (3 block - stops X damage then block is reduced by X, deal dmg = to block, 2x block, multihit when block > 10)

## relic reward screen

- 25% life steal while HP is lower than 50%
- upgrades are 2x more likely to be seen
- play first each battle twice
- deal one dmg at the end of your turn
- always get an upgrade option each card selection
- Jesus Take the Wheel: card selections made for you at random, double your max HP (you can still pick relics)
- more relics
- more enemies
- more selectable characters
- game engine analysis

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
